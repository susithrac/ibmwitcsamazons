    <p>The greenhouse gas emissions produced by growing, rearing, farming, processing, transporting, storing, cooking, and disposing of the food we eat are referred to as the foodprint</p>
    <p>Eat low on the food chain. This means eating mostly fruits, veggies, grains, and beans, mainly from feed production and processing and the methane (25 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere over 100 years) that beef and sheep belch out</p>
    <p>Every day that we forgo meat and dairy, we can reduce our carbon footprint by 8 pounds—that’s 2,920 pounds a year. We can start by joining Meatless Mondays</p>
