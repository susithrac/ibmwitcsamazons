## Short description

### What's the problem?

Planet is suffering due to climate changes and global warming
Sea levels are expected to rise between 10 and 32 inches or higher by the end of the century
Hurricanes and other storms are likely to become stronger. 
Floods and droughts will become more common
CO2 produced by human activities is the largest contributor to global warming
The electricity, oil and gas used to light and heat our homes and businesses is the single biggest contributing factor to climate change

### How can technology help?

The application allows the individual to enter the values for various carbon emission factors and calculates Carbon Footprint thereby making each and every individual aware about their ongoing Carbon Footprint activities. 
It also provides them a means to reduce the carbon footprint by improving and monitoring temperature controls,
reducing energy demand and replacing it with renewable and carbon neutral sources,
reducing how much people travel within the technology sector and using ICT tools as alternatives to travel across all industry

### The idea

Need for a system which will help to understand the factors contributing to environmental issues, track them and try to reduce them.
Reduce, Reuse and Recycle wherever possible.
Calculating Carbon footprint according to various factors can make people aware about seriousness of the situation and reduce un-necessary burden on planet earth.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](./docs/architectural_diag.JPG)

1. User logins to the web application through google, facebook or the IBM account
2. The web application recieves input from the user for various carbon emission factors
3. The data is analysed and the carbon footprint is calculated and data is stored in the database
4. The calculated result is then displayed to the user

## Long description

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things

- Users can key in the carbon emission factor values
- Calculating Carbon footprint according to various factors
- Provides a graphical representation of the calculated Carbon Footprint
- Individual can take full responsibility for the climate impact by offsetting the emissions

See below for our proposed enhancement on next steps for Carbon Footprint calculation
